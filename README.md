# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My name is JT Williams and this is my website I have constructed using HTML, CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap!

This project is designed to be a personal blog. Details about the project are as follows:

The project 0 folder contains the static folder, templates folder, ideas.txt, and README.md (this file).

The static folder contains the stylistic code in styles.css that is compiled from styles.scss.

The tempates folder contains the HTML files for the website. Each HTML file corresponds to different pieces
of the blog. bootstrap.html is a website for fun with Bootstrap. deutsch.html is a website about learning
the German language. index.html is the "Home" website for the blog. reading.html is a blog about books.
ultimate.html is a blog about the sport of ultimate, also known as "ultimate frisbee". videogames.HTML is a
blog about video games.

ideas.txt contains ideas and notes for the website.

The README.md file is this file!



Thanks!
JT Williams
